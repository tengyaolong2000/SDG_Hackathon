# Problem Statement and motivation

Unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity are leading global risks to health.
According to a new scientific study, poor diet is responsible for more deaths globally than tobacco, high blood pressure, or any other health risk.
Consuming low amounts of healthy foods, such as whole grains, and too much unhealthy foods, including sweetened beverages, account for one in every five deaths globally.

## Just like a Mirror, our app aims to reflect the current You and help you achieve the best version of You.

# What our app does

Our app has 3 main functions: The food tracker, exercise tracker and personalised exercise regime. The food tracker utilizes Computer Vision to recognize the food taken and outputs its calories. The exercise tracker tracks exercises and the muscles worked. The personalised regime (fitness and diet) employs an algorithm with the users’ fitness level and other information to give the user an optimised training routine and diet plan.

# How our app is different, and Scalability

Majority fitness apps on the market focuses only on fitness. Such apps are designed more as a ‘Single Player” app to. Our app on the other hand focuses on not only fitness but also diet. Additionally, we leverage the power of competition as a source of motivation with habit formation as our end goal by deploying a leaderboard (and rewards). Such an approach greatly helps in giving less self-disciplined users a reason to exercise and eat healthily via social pressure when they see their friends climbing the ranks. Additionally, our algorithmically generated personalised plan give users an idea of where to start if they do not have their own routines.

Our current Computer Vision Demo utilizes Google’s Tensorflow library. In the future, we could store our data on the Google Cloud Database and use Google Cloud’s new unified ML platform Vertex AI to deploy our model. Additionally, our app could be made in Flutter so that it is compatible with a wide range of devices.
